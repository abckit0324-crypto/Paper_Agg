# UptimeRobot Configuration Guide
# This file contains instructions for keeping your Render deployment always-on

## Step-by-Step Setup (5 minutes):

1. Sign up at: https://uptimerobot.com/ (FREE)

2. Click "Add New Monitor"

3. Configure:
   - Monitor Type: HTTP(s)
   - Friendly Name: Paper Aggregator Demo
   - URL: https://your-app-name.onrender.com/
   - Monitoring Interval: 5 minutes
   
4. Click "Create Monitor"

5. Done! Your app will now stay warm 24/7

## How it works:
- UptimeRobot pings your app every 5 minutes
- This prevents Render from spinning down (which happens after 15 min inactivity)
- Your app responds instantly to all requests
- Completely free (UptimeRobot free tier: 50 monitors, 5-min intervals)

## Alternative: Use a cron job
If you have a server or local machine that's always on:

```bash
# Add to crontab (runs every 10 minutes)
*/10 * * * * curl -s https://your-app-name.onrender.com/ > /dev/null
```

## Monitoring Dashboard:
UptimeRobot provides:
- Uptime percentage
- Response time graphs
- Email alerts if your app goes down
- Public status pages (optional)
