# Paper Aggregator

A modern, web-based tool for aggregating and tracking accepted papers from major AI, Machine Learning, and Computer Security conferences (CVPR, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, ICCV, ECCV, USENIX Security, IEEE S&P, ACM CCS, NDSS).

## Features

- **Multi-Conference Support**: Scrapers for over 10 major conferences covering 2022-2026.
- **Selective Scrape**: Choose specific conferences to update directly from the UI.
- **Real-time Logs**: Monitor scraping progress with a built-in log console.
- **Paper Tagging**: Automatically identifies and tags "Short Papers" (e.g., posters/demos) based on page counts.
- **Modern UI**: Dark-themed, responsive interface with robust filtering by keyword, year, and conference.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Conda** (recommended)

## Installation & Deployment

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RunWang123/Paper_Agg.git
cd Paper_Agg
```

### 2. Set Up Environment
Using Conda:
```bash
conda create -n paper_agg python=3.9
conda activate paper_agg
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Initialize & Run
The project includes a `run.sh` script that handles environment activation, database initialization, and starting the FastAPI server.

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

Alternatively, run the server manually:
```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```
